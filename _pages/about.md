Hello, I am **Yichi Zhang** 张亦弛, an undergraduate student majoring in **Information Engineering** at the College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University. I am also minoring in **Computer Science and Technology** at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University.  

Previously, my main research direction was in **image/video generation and restoration**, under the guidance of Professor Xu. The recent emergence of models such as Stable Diffusion in the field of computer vision, and language models like ChatGPT in the field of natural language processing, has prompted me to focus on researching the **robustness and attack-defense of large models** represented by GPT or Diffusion Models under the guidance of Professor Xu and Professor Ji, and examining whether such models truly have robustness. 

Robustness & Sercurity in Machine Learning
======
The robustness issue of large models represented by GPT refers to whether these models can maintain stable performance when facing unknown or abnormal inputs, without becoming overconfident or crashing. These models are typically constructed based on deep learning neural networks, with millions to billions of parameters.

However, the robustness issue of these large models remains a challenge. On the one hand, these models are usually trained on large-scale datasets, but in practical applications, issues such as imbalanced data distribution, noise interference, and adversarial samples are often encountered, which may cause the model's performance to decline. On the other hand, some studies have shown that the overconfidence and vulnerability to adversarial attacks of these large models can cause security risks.
