Hello, I am **Yichi Zhang** 张亦弛, an undergraduate student majoring in **Information Engineering** at the College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University. I am also minoring in **Computer Science and Technology** at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University.  

Previously, my main research direction was in **image/video generation and restoration**, under the guidance of Professor Xu. The recent emergence of models such as Stable Diffusion in the field of computer vision, and language models like ChatGPT in the field of natural language processing, has prompted me to focus on researching the **robustness and attack-defense of large models** represented by GPT under the guidance of Professor Ji and Professor Xu, and examining whether such models truly have robustness. 

Robustness of Machine Learning
======
The robustness issue of large models represented by GPT refers to whether these models can maintain stable performance when facing unknown or abnormal inputs, without becoming overconfident or crashing. These models are typically constructed based on deep learning neural networks, with millions to billions of parameters.

However, the robustness issue of these large models remains a challenge. On the one hand, these models are usually trained on large-scale datasets, but in practical applications, issues such as imbalanced data distribution, noise interference, and adversarial samples are often encountered, which may cause the model's performance to decline. On the other hand, some studies have shown that the overconfidence and vulnerability to adversarial attacks of these large models can cause security risks.

Video/Image Generation and Restoration
======
The problem of video/image generation and restoration refers to the use of computer algorithms and techniques to process existing images or videos, to generate new images or videos, or to restore defects in existing images or videos. This problem is very important in the field of computer vision and image processing, as it can be used to improve image and video quality, enhance information content, and restore damaged or degraded images or videos.

Image generation problems typically involve generating high-resolution images, super-resolution images, style transfer images, and so on. These techniques can be used to enhance image quality, making the image more detailed, clear, and natural.

Image restoration problems involve repairing damaged images, such as removing noise, filling in missing pixels, or repairing partially damaged images. These techniques can be used to restore old photos, medical images, remove watermarks, and so on.
