## Overall framework
The paper proposes a novel framework for video restoration, which utilizes neural network compression for initial processing of noisy videos, and then employs a feature learning-based approach for video restoration.

The video restoration framework consists of three modules:

* **Feature alignment**: Given a previous frame and a current frame, motion estimation is used to obtain motion vectors, which are refined using a motion vector refinement module. The previous frame's temporal features are then combined with the refined motion vectors using bilinear warping to obtain coarse features.

* **Feature refinement via neural compression**: This module includes an attention module and a neural compression module. The attention module is designed to expand temporal features to aid feature learning, while the neural compression module consists of an encoder-decoder, quantization process, and prior model, which are used for noise reduction and noise feature learning.

* **Feature fusion**: This module includes a restoration module, which fuses noise-robust temporal features with the current frame to generate the final output frame.

## Innovations

* Refining motion vectors before feature alignment.
* Using neural compression for noise reduction and noise feature learning.
* Employing variable quantization step size in image compression.

## Experimental design

The framework is compared against several baselines, including VNLNet, DVDNet, FastDVDNet, EMVD, EDVR, BasicVSR, BasicVSR++, and RViDeNet. Experiments were conducted on both large (EDVR-L) and small (EMVD-S) models, and the original BasicVSR/BasicVSR++ was modified to use only past frames' temporal features for fair comparison with other methods.

The paper also includes experiments on video denoising, dehazing, and deraining, using PSNR and SSIM as quantitative evaluation metrics, as well as ablation studies to explore the impact of different modules on the overall architecture and the effect of bidirectionality.
