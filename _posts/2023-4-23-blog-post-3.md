Today I finished the Assignment-004 "Personal Diary" in the course Object-Oriented-Programming, which takes me 4 hours to finish. The source code has been uploaded to my github repo **"Object-Oriented-Programming"**.

## What I learned
Once again wrote a CLI software composed of multiple files and learned how to write bash scripts in the first time. 

## Input
There five command you can input in total, they are:
* Usage: usage
* Add: add <filename\>
* Show: show <filename\> <date\>
* Remove: remove <filename\> <date\>
* List: list <filename\> <start\>(optional) <end\>(optional)

## Demo
In order to operate the Personal Diary more efficiently, I wrote diary.bash. You can run it to test the correctness of this software.
Now, we have the diary.txt contains:
