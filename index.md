## About Me

Hello, I am Yichi Zhang 张亦弛, an undergraduate student at Zhejiang University, majoring in Information Engineering and minoring in Computer Science and Technology. Currently, I am taking courses in my third year and participating in research work at [NESA Lab](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Professor [Xiaogang Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R65xDQwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Professor [Shouling Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5HoF_9oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

<!-- 我是张亦弛，一名浙江大学的本科生，在信息与电子工程学院主修信息工程，在计算机科学与技术学院辅修计算机科学与技术专业。目前我正在修读大三的课程，同时在NESA Lab参加科研工作，我接受徐晓刚教授和纪守领教授的指导。 -->

My research interests mainly include **Machine Learning**, as well as **Privacy and Security** issues in machine learning. In the past three months, I have been working on detecting images generated by high-quality image generators, to prevent users from suffering privacy leakage and property loss caused by fake images. On this problem, I have made my first work achievement, DNF. DNF leverages the estimation noise generated for images during the diffusion process, and can successfully detect images generated by DALL·E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc. Currently, I am exploring the issues of backdoor attacks and defenses in Federated Learning, as well as the robustness and interpretability of Large Language/Vision Models, and try to make novel enough work to prove my ability.

<!-- 目前，我正在探究联邦学习中的后门攻防问题以及大模型的鲁棒性和可解释性问题 -->
