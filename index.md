## About Me

Hello, I am **Yichi Zhang** (张亦弛), an undergraduate student at Zhejiang University, majoring in Information Engineering and minoring in Computer Science and Technology. Currently, I am taking courses in my third year and participating in research work at [NESA Lab](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Professor [Xiaogang Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R65xDQwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Professor [Shouling Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5HoF_9oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

**I am looking for summer research internship opportunities on 24 Summer. Remote internship immediately or Summer internship.**


## Research Interest

* **Trustworthy AI**
* **Generative AI**
* Machine Learning

My primary research interests currently encompass **Trustworthy AI and Machine Learning**. Under the guidance of Professor **Shouling Ji**, I have become familiar with the issues of backdoor attacks and defenses in both federated learning systems and conventional centralized deep learning systems. I also focus on enhancing the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (LVMs) against attacks. 

Prior to this, under the mentorship of Professor **Xiaogang Xu**, I was committed to **detecting AI-generated images** to prevent people from falling victim to telecommunication fraud. In this process, we utilized a reverse diffusion process to separate the distributions of real and generated images. Ultimately, we achieved a high-precision method for detecting generated images, known as **DNF**.

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me at yichics02@gmail.com.
