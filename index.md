## About Me

Hello, I am **Yichi Zhang** (张亦弛), an undergraduate student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), majoring in **Information Engineering** and minoring in **Computer Science and Technology**. Currently, I am taking courses in my fourth year and participating in research work at [NESA Lab](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Prof. [Xiaogang Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R65xDQwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Prof. [Shouling Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5HoF_9oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I also collaborate with Prof. [Ting Wang](https://alps-lab.github.io/) as summer research intern.

## Research Interest

To develop trustworthy AI systems for critical applications, I believe it is essential to address three key factors: **robustness**, **safety**, and **interpretability**. Driven by these considerations, I aim to explore the following research questions: (i) How can we ensure that models maintain sufficient robustness during interactions with external environments, protecting them from hidden threats? (ii) How can we minimize bias and harmful content in model outputs to promote fairness and reliability? (iii) How can we establish comprehensive benchmarks that quantifies the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs from multiple dimensions to enhancing interpretability?
