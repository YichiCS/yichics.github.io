## About Me

My research interests include **Machine Learning**, as well as **Privacy and Security** in artificial intelligence systems. Over the past six months, I have been dedicated to detecting images generated by high-quality image generators to ensure people are protected from misinformation. Currently, I am fully immersed in researching backdoor attacks in machine learning and their detection, attempting to find a robust attack paradigm and a sufficiently generalizable means of detecting/neutralizing attacks to protect models from data poisoning backdoor attacks.

I have been seeking like-minded partners to collaborate with and welcome any outreach at your convenience.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning
