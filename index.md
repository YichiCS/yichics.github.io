## About Me

Hello, I am Yichi Zhang 张亦弛, an undergraduate student at Zhejiang University, majoring in Information Engineering and minoring in Computer Science and Technology. Currently, I am taking courses in my third year and participating in research work at [NESA Lab](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Professor [Xiaogang Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R65xDQwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Professor [Shouling Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5HoF_9oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).


## Research Interest

* Trustworthy AI
* Generative AI
* Machine Learning

My primary research interests currently encompass Trustworthy AI and Machine Learning. Under the guidance of Professor Shouling Ji, I have become familiar with the issues of backdoor attacks and defenses in both federated learning systems and conventional centralized deep learning systems. I also focus on enhancing the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (LVMs) against attacks. Prior to this, under the mentorship of Professor Xiaogang Xu, I was committed to detecting AI-generated images to prevent people from falling victim to telecommunication fraud. In this process, we utilized a reverse diffusion process to separate the distributions of real and generated images. Ultimately, we achieved a high-precision method for detecting generated images, known as DNF.

<!-- 目前我的主要研究方向主要包括可信人工智能和机器学习。在纪守领教授的指导下，我对联邦学习系统和常规中心化深度学习系统中的后门攻防问题较为熟悉，同时我还关注如何提升LLM/LVM面对攻击时的鲁棒性。在这之前，我在徐晓刚教授的指导下，致力于检测AI生成的图像，防止人们遭受电信诈骗的危害。在这个过程中，我们使用反向扩散过程在分离真实图像分布和生成图像分布，最后实现了一种高精度的生成图像检测方法，名为DNF。 -->
